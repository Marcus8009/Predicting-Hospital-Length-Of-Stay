# Predicting-Hospital-Length-Of-Stay
Predicting Hospital Length of Stay at Admission Via a Machine Learning Approach
In this project, I performed data exploration using Power BI to uncover relationships between variables and identify data quality issues. I then applied machine learning techniques in Python, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests, to develop a predictive model for estimating patient length of stay (LOS) upon hospital admission. This model aims to provide more accurate predictions than the traditional mean LOS used in healthcare planning and insurance approvals.
