# Predicting-Hospital-Length-Of-Stay
Predicting Hospital Length of Stay at Admission Via a Machine Learning Approach
In this project, I conducted data exploration using Power BI to uncover relationships between variables and identify data quality issues. After addressing these quality issues in Python, I applied machine learning techniques—including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests—to develop a predictive model for estimating patient length of stay (LOS) upon hospital admission. This model aims to provide more accurate predictions than the traditional mean LOS currently used in healthcare planning and insurance approvals.
